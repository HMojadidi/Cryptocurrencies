# Cryptocurrencies

In this challenge, I used unsupervised machine learning to analyze a cryptocurrency dataset. 
Four technical analysis took place:

* Preprocessing the Data for PCA
* Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
* Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
* Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results

The K-means algorithm was used to create an elbow curve plot. This allowed me to find the best value for k, and thus the best number of clusters for the available data.

In order to visualize the data, I created a 3D scatter plot using the PCA data.

Finally, I transformed data for "Total Coin Supply" and "Total Coins Mined", which was used to create a 2D scatter plot.
